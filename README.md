# BMP Counter

BPM Counter is a website that measures your heart rate. Here's what you do:

1. Find your pulse by pressing two of your fingers against your neck.
2. Once you've found it, tap the button in the center of the screen once for every pulse that you feel.
3. Continue tapping for at least 10 seconds.
4. When you are done, the app will tell you what your heartrate was!
